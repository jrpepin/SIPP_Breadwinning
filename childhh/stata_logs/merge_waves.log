. * I would love to turn off line wrap so the state is a single
. * continuous string.  This seems not to be possible.  The best
. * we can do is set the line length to 255.  That's about 20 times
. * too short so why bother.
. *
. * Also, I considered saving the state as a note in the dataset
. * but this generic do file can't assume there is a dataset at all.
